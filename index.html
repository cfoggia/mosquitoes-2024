                  <h5>Bed Net</h5>
                  <p>Bed nets are an effective way to protect yourself from mosquito bites while sleeping, especially in areas where mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Zika are prevalent. They provide a physical       barrier that keeps mosquitoes out of your sleeping area.
                    For enhanced protection, it's best to use bed nets that are treated with insect repellent (such as permethrin), as this further deters mosquitoes from approaching. It's also important to ensure the net is properly tucked in and free from holes to maintain its effectiveness.
                    When combined with other mosquito control measures—such as eliminating standing water where mosquitoes breed—bed nets offer a simple and reliable way to reduce the risk of being bitten and contracting harmful diseases.</p>

                  <h5>Life Cycle of a Mosquito</h5>
                  <p>The mosquito life cycle has four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in or near water, where they hatch into larvae, which feed and grow. After several molts, the larvae become pupae, a resting stage, before emerging as adult mosquitoes. The entire process typically takes about 1 to 2 weeks, depending on environmental conditions. Female mosquitoes then seek blood meals to produce eggs, continuing the cycle.</p>

         <h1>Mosquito Diseases</h1>
         <p>Mosquitoes are notorious vectors for a variety of viral diseases that affect humans. These viruses are typically transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, and they are caused by different types of viruses. Below are some of the major viral diseases spread by mosquitoes, along with an explanation of the viruses and where they come from:<p>

            <p><ls>1. Dengue Fever</ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Virus: Dengue virus (DENV)</ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Vector: Primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, although Aedes albopictus can also spread it. Where It Comes From: Dengue fever is common in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The virus is thought to have originated in the forests of Southeast Asia and has spread globally due to increased travel and urbanization.</ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Symptoms: High fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain (pain behind the eyes), rash, joint and muscle pain, and in severe cases, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>2. Zika Virus</ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Virus: Zika virus (ZIKV)</ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Vector: Primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito and to a lesser extent Aedes albopictus.<ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Where It Comes From: Zika virus is believed to have originated in Africa, where it was first identified in monkeys in the Zika Forest of Uganda in the 1940s. It spread to Asia and then into the Americas, notably causing widespread outbreaks in the Caribbean and Latin America in 2015-2016.<ls></p>
                            <p><ls>Symptoms: Most people infected with Zika virus show mild symptoms, including fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). However, Zika has been associated with serious birth defects, particularly microcephaly (a condition where babies are born with smaller-than-normal heads) when pregnant women are infected.<ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>3. West Nile Virus</ls></p>
            <p><ls>Virus: West Nile virus (WNV)</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Vector: Primarily Culex mosquitoes, especially Culex pipiens.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Where It Comes From: West Nile virus is native to Africa, but it spread to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia before reaching North America in 1999. It is now found in many parts of the world, including the United States.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Symptoms: Most people infected with West Nile virus do not show symptoms, but some develop flu-like symptoms (fever, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue). In rare cases, the virus can cause severe neurological diseases like encephalitis or meningitis, especially in older adults.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>4. Malaria (Although a Parasite, Not a Virus)</ls></p>
            Parasite: Plasmodium spp. (There are several species, including P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale)</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Vector: Anopheles mosquitoes</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Where It Comes From: Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which has ancient origins. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of Latin America.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Symptoms: Malaria causes recurrent fever, chills, headache, and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure, cerebral malaria, and death. Malaria is a major global health issue, though it is preventable and treatable with antimalarial drugs.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>5. Chikungunya</ls></p>
            <p><ls>Virus: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Vector: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Where It Comes From: Chikungunya virus is believed to have originated in sub-Saharan Africa, but outbreaks have occurred in parts of Asia, Europe, and the Americas since the 2000s.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Symptoms: Symptoms of chikungunya fever include sudden onset of high fever, severe joint pain (which can be debilitating), muscle pain, rash, and headache. While the disease is rarely fatal, joint pain can persist for months.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>6. Yellow Fever</ls></p>
            <p><ls>Virus: Yellow fever virus (YFV)</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Vector: Primarily Aedes aegypti, but also other mosquito species like Haemagogus mosquitoes in jungle settings.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Where It Comes From: Yellow fever is an ancient disease that originated in Africa and spread to the Americas during the colonial era. It remains a significant threat in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South America.</ls></p>
            
            <p><ls>Symptoms: Yellow fever starts with fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches. In severe cases, it can lead to liver damage, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), bleeding, shock, and death. There is an effective vaccine for yellow fever, which has helped control outbreaks in endemic regions.</ls></p>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>Avoid Mosquito Bites<p>
                        <p><ls>• Apply Insect Repellent when you go outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, Ndiethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), IR3535 or oil of lemon
                        eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)] according to the instructions on the
                        product label. DEET products should not be used on infants under two months of
                        age and should be used in concentrations of 30% or less on older children. Oil of
                        lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under three years of age.
                        Permethrin products are intended for use on items such as clothing, shoes, bed
                        nets and camping gear and should not be applied to skin.</ls></p>
                        </p><ls>• Clothing Can Help reduce mosquito bites. Although it may be difficult to do
                        when it’s hot, wearing long-sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will
                        help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.</ls></p> 
                        </p><ls>• Be Aware of Peak Mosquito Hours - The hours from dusk to dawn are peak
                        biting times for many mosquitoes. When risk is increased, consider rescheduling
                        outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning. If you are outdoors at any time and  notice mosquitoes around you, take steps to avoid being bitten by moving indoors, covering up and/or wearing repellant.<ls></p>
                <p>Mosquito-Proof Your Home</p>
                        </p><ls>• Drain Standing Water – Many mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit
                        the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either
                        draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains.
                        Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools and change water in birdbaths
                        frequently.
                         </p><ls>• Install or Repair Screens - Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them
                        outside by having tightly-fitting screens on all your windows and doors.<ls></p>
